# Introduction to Kotlin

## History
Kotlin is a modern programming language created by JetBrains starting in 2010 and officially released in 2016. Its creation aimed to address the shortcomings of Java while being fully interoperable with it. Kotlin is designed to be a more concise, expressive, and safer language, allowing developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code. The language gained significant momentum after Google announced Kotlin as the preferred language for Android application development in 2019.

Kotlin was open-sourced in 2012, meaning the source code behind it was available to view as well as contribute to. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin).

## Uses
Kotlin is a versatile, multi-functional language suitable for a wide range of applications. The language is designed to be both pragmatic and expressive, offering features that make development faster, safer, and more enjoyable for developers of all levels. Kotlin is a great language to learn and master given how applicable it is to various disciplines within the world of programming, such as:

* **Web Development**: With frameworks like Ktor and Spring, Kotlin is becoming a go-to language for creating modern web applications.
* **Mobile Development**: Kotlin is the preferred language for Android app development, offering a more modern and streamlined alternative to Java.
* **Server-Side Development**: Kotlin is fully compatible with the JVM, which makes it an excellent choice for building server-side applications, especially when combined with frameworks like Ktor or Spring Boot.
* **Data Science**: Kotlin's concise syntax and powerful features, such as Kotlin DataFrames and libraries like KotlinDL, are gaining traction in the data science community.
* **Desktop Applications**: Kotlin can be used to build cross-platform desktop applications throughout Kotlin Multiplatform.

Throughout the course of this module, you'll be able to learn the foundations of Kotlin. Afterwards, you will be able to explore each domain and how to make use of Kotlin in each.

## Features of Kotlin
Kotlin offers a wide range of features that make it an attractive option for developers. One of the most notable is its null safety, which significantly reduces the risk of null pointer exceptions. The language distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types, providing built-in mechanisms to handle null references safely. Kotlin also offers concise syntax, allowing developers to write less code while maintaining readability and expressiveness. This leads to more efficient development cycles and reduced boilerplate code. Kotlin is also fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can seamlessly call Kotlin code from Java and vice versa, which is a key advantage for developers transitioning from Java or maintaining mixed codebases. Kotlin’s coroutines provide a simple yet powerful way to handle asynchronous programming, making it easier to manage concurrency in applications while avoiding the complexities of traditional threading models.

## Getting Started with Kotlin
In the following lessons, you’ll be guided step-by-step through the process of setting up your Kotlin programming environment. You’ll learn how to install the necessary tools, configure your IDE, and write your first Kotlin program. After that, we’ll explore the basics of Kotlin syntax and key programming concepts. You'll gain hands-on experience through real-life projects, which will help you apply what you've learned and build practical skills. By the end of this module, you’ll be well-equipped to start developing your own Kotlin applications with confidence!
