# Comments
Comments are text annotations within source code that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to add additional information to the written code.

## Single-Line Comments
Single-line comments begin with two forward slashes `//`. Any text that comes after these two slashes is ignored and does not impact the code in any way.

`// This is a comment`

`println("Minecraft") // This is a comment`


## Multi-Line Comments
Multi-line comments span over multiple lines. The start of it begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

## Documentation Comments
**KDoc** is a language used to document Kotlin code, the equivalent of Java's Javadoc. These comments begin with `/**` and end with `*/`. Each line in between these markers must begin with an asterisk.
