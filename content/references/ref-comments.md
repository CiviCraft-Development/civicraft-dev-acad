# Comments

## Single-Line Comments
`// This is a single line comment`

## Multi-Line Comments
```java
/*
This is a 
multi-line comment
*/
```

## Doc Comments
```java
/**
* Upload a fil to a web server.
*
* @param file The file to upload.
* @return <tt>true</tt> on success,
*         <tt>false</tt> on failure.

```

## Best Practices
* Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.
* Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
* Explain "why," not "what."
* Keep comments updated to reflect code changes.
* Avoid redundant or obvious comments.
