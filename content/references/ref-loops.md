# Loops

## For Loops
A for loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to iterate.
```java
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

### For Each Loops
A for-each loop is used to iterate over each element in an array or collection. It simplifies iteration and avoids manual indexing.
```java
for (dataType variable : collection) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

## While Loops
A while loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a condition that may change during execution.
```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

## Do-While Loops
A do-while loop is used when you need the code to run at least once before checking the condition.
```java
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```
