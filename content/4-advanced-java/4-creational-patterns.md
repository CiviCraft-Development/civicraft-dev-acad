# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide blueprints for building efficient, maintainable, and scalable applications, helping developers streamline development and reduce errors. These patterns address recurring challenges in object creation, code structure, and behavior management.

There are three types of design patterns we'll explore throughout this lesson.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational Design Patterns are design patterns that focus on the process of creating objects. They are purposed to enhance flexibility and efficiency in object creation, allowing systems to remain independent of how their objects are constructed. 

### Factor Method Design Pattern
### Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern
### Singleton Method Design Pattern
### Prototype Method Design Pattern
