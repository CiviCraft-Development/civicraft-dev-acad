# Introduction to CCDA
Hello and welcome to CiviCraft Developer Academy! CCDA is an open-source learning platform for all things Minecraft plugin development. Our structured curriculum emphasizes practical skills, ethical coding practices, and community collaboration, enabling you to create functional and innovative plugins.

## Prerequisites
CCDA is designed to be accessible to learners of all backgrounds, with no formal prerequisites required to complete the program. Whether you're entirely new to programming or already have some experience, you can succeed here. That being said, having a foundational understanding of computer science and programming concepts can help you progress more smoothly. While we cover a lot of this within our own curriculum, supplementing your learning with additional all-inclusive resources can strengthen your skills and confidence.

## Module and Lesson Structure
CCDA’s curriculum is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific subject area, and further divided into individual lessons for targeted learning.

### Modules
Modules are collections of lessons that are designed to build on one another, with each new topic logically extending the knowledge gained from previous ones. To maximize your learning, we recommend following the pre-defined learning paths, which are carefully curated to provide the best outcomes.

Every module begins with an introduction that outlines its objectives and provides historical or technical context to deepen your understanding of the subject. All modules end with an all-encompassing project that allows you to apply everything you learned within the module.

### Lessons
Lessons focus on specific topics within each module's subject area, providing a structured approach to learning. Each lesson begins with explanations of key concepts, followed by real-world examples that demonstrate their application. Practical exercises are included to help you test and reinforce your understanding, ranging from simple syntax drills to more complex feature implementations. At the end of every lesson, you’ll find curated additional resources, such as documentation links and community-recommended videos and articles, to further deepen your knowledge and explore topics in greater detail.

## Getting the Most out of CCDA
1. **Write Code Daily**  
Reinforce concepts by building small projects, even for 15–30 minutes daily. Visit our project list for ideas!
2. **Engage Actively**  
Type examples manually instead of copying them. Experiment with and tweak the code. Build projects and solve problems, small or large.
3. **Problem-Solve Independently**  
Analyze error messages thoroughly before seeking help. Most issues can be resolved by reviewing documentation or prior lessons.
4. **Leverage the Community**  
Use our Discord for help with your code, further concept explanations, and support. Celebrate your progress and accomplishments with us, too!
