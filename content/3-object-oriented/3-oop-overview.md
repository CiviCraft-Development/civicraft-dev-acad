# Object-Oriented Programming Overview
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most widely used programming approaches, and for good reason. It provides a structured way to design and organize code, making it easier to manage, reuse, and maintain. By modeling real-world entities as objects, OOP allows you to create programs that are more intuitive and aligned with how we naturally think about problems. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale system, understanding OOP will help you write cleaner, more efficient, and more scalable code.

In this module, we’ve explored the core concepts of OOP: inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. We also discussed classes, objects, methods, and attributes, and how to use them. These are tools you’ll use every day as a programmer, no matter what you go on to create. We'll recap each concept and next, we'll put all these concepts to use with a practical project: a library management system!

## Classes and Objects
- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
- **Object:** An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own state and behavior.
